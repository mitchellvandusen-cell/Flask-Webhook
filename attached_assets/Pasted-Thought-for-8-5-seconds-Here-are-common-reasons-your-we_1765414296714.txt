Here are common reasons your webhook may be marked as "unsuccessful" for sending texts to your insurance bot:

URL Error or Unreachable Endpoint
Double-check that the webhook URL (https://InsuranceGrokBot.replit.app/) is correct, live, and reachable from Automation.

Missing or Incorrect Data
Make sure all required data fields (like phone or message) are properly mapped and not empty. If a required value is blank or not passed, the bot may reject the request.

Server-Side Issues
The destination server (your insurance bot) might be having errors, downtime, or is returning error codes (like 400 or 500 series responses).

Authentication or Permissions
If your webhook requires authentication or headers, ensure these are correctly set up. Your webhook is currently not passing any headers.

Contact Data Issues
If you use custom values like {{contact.phone}} or {{contact.first_name}}, make sure these fields exist and contain valid data for the contact.

Rate Limits or Payload Issues
Some platforms limit the frequency or size of requests. Large batches or fast-dripping could cause some calls to be rejected.

What you can do:

Check the detailed error message or status code for the webhook in the workflow logs.
Review the contact's data fields to ensure nothing is blank or invalid.
Test your webhook URL with sample data using a tool like Postman to see if it accepts your payload.
Confirm if the insurance bot’s endpoint is operational and can accept incoming requests.

Workflow AI
Thought for 6.9 seconds
The workflow does not currently include any specific step to check for error messages or response codes from the webhook calls. The webhook actions just send the request and move to the next step without validating if the call was successful or returned any errors.

How to troubleshoot webhook responses:

If you want to capture and act on errors or response codes, you would need to use a custom action or set up your webhook endpoint to send a specific tag or trigger back to Automation on failure.
You can also monitor your webhook endpoint (the one on "InsuranceGrokBot.replit.app") for any failed or error responses directly from your server logs or add error notifications within your endpoint.
Recommendation:
To handle errors within the workflow, you would typically:

Set up your webhook endpoint to return a specific value or trigger when an error occurs.
Use an "If/Else" condition in your workflow to check for that response or for the presence/absence of a confirmation tag.
Route the workflow based on the result for additional error handling or retries.
