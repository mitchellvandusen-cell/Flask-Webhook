for structured, non-repetitive dialogues.
4. Rasa (`pip install rasa`)
	•	An end-to-end open-source framework for building conversational AI, with strong support for natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue management, and state tracking. It allows you to define intents, entities, and slots (e.g., tracking “policy_type” as a slot that persists across turns), enabling cross-referencing via custom actions or policies. Verification comes built-in through forms and rules to ensure consistent flow—e.g., if a user confirms “term policy,” Rasa can lock that slot and skip related questions. Integrate it as your bot’s core engine alongside spaCy for entity extraction, querying your PostgreSQL for persistent memory to make context loss virtually impossible.
5. DeepPavlov (`pip install deeppavlov`)
	•	A flexible library for dialogue systems, focusing on modular components like intent classification, entity recognition, and dialogue state tracking. It stores conversation details in configurable pipelines (e.g., using BERT-based models for semantic understanding), allowing extensive cross-referencing through knowledge graphs or vector embeddings. For verification, it includes spell-checking, ranking, and consistency checks to flag mismatches (e.g., conflicting “duration” values). Use it in your preprocessing step to analyze words/intents from history, pulling from in-memory or DB caches, ensuring smooth progression in insurance queries without redundant probing.
6. MindMeld (`pip install mindmeld`)
	•	Cisco’s open-source platform for production-grade chatbots, emphasizing hierarchical dialogue management and entity resolution. It tracks language elements via parsers and domains (e.g., grouping “insurance” terms), with built-in cross-referencing through query resolvers and state handlers that verify facts against prior context. This prevents misunderstandings by enforcing workflows—e.g., advancing only after validating “living benefits” mentions. Combine with your unified_brain.py for data access, using its app structure to handle GHL webhooks, making repetition rare by design.
